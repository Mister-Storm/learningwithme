            - **JaCoCo coverage:** `${{ steps.parse.outputs.coverage }}%`
            - **PIT mutation coverage:** `${{ steps.parse.outputs.mutation }}%`
            - Reports (JaCoCo & PIT) and `.ci-history` archived as workflow artifacts in the build job.
            - Note: mutation & coverage steps are allowed-to-fail in CI (they won't block the merge).
