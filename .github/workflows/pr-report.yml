            ## 📊 CI Coverage summary
            - **JaCoCo coverage:** `${{ steps.parse.outputs.coverage }}%`
            - **PIT mutation coverage:** `${{ steps.parse.outputs.mutation }}%`
            - Artifacts: coverage & pit HTML uploaded to the workflow run artifacts.
            - Note: mutation & coverage steps are allowed to fail in CI (they won't block the merge).
